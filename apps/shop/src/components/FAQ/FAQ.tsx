        question: "Do you take custom orders?",

            I can't always guarantee it, but send me a message and I can let you know!

        question: "Is this safe for children?",
        answer: `
            For plushies the safety eyes are secured on but 
            there is always a small chance that a small child 
            may choke on them if the eyes were to fall off.
            
            For pins the backing without the rubber stopper is sharp.
        `
    },
    {
        question: "Can you make modifications on existing plushies?",
        answer: `
            If they are already finished I cannot, but I can definitely make a custom made one for you.
        `
    },
    {
        question: "Do you have other sizes available?",

            Unfortunately no, they only come in one size (large). 
        `

        question: "Are they returnable?",

            All plushies are final sale.

        question: "Do they come to life?",
        answer: `
            Not that I know of but I can't say for sure. ðŸ‘€
        `
    },
    {
        question: "What are they made out of?",
        answer: `
            My plushies are made from chenille yarn, polyfill stuffing, acrylic safety eyes.
        `
    },
    {
        question: "Are they safe to wash?",
        answer: `
            I would recommend using a wet wipe first and foremost, but absolute worst case if you put it in the wash make sure to wash on delicate.
